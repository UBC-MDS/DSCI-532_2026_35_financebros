# Contributing

Contributions of all kinds are welcome here, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

* [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
* [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
* [Implement Features](#implement-features)
* [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
* [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

## Workflow
We are documenting our issues on GitHub issues, as well as on the GitHub Projects board for our repository. 
We will also edit the changelog file for each release. Our collaboration stategy is based on what we've learned in DSCI 524 and 522.

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_35_financebros/issues.

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and
`help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on such
an issue, please assign yourself to it and add a comment that you'll be working on that,
too. If you see another issue without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the
maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As
for [fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please assign yourself to the issue and add a comment that
you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement catches your fancy, but it
doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are usually
happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

DSCI-532_2026_35_financebros could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just
[open an issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_35_financebros/issues)
to let us know what you will be working on so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI-532_2026_35_financebros/issues. If your feedback fits the format of one of
the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven
project and everybody has limited time.
